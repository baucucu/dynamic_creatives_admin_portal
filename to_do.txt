# Clients page
###### Option to select present datetime or insert manually
###### Drop down to select brief and user that client is associated with + creation of new brief/client

# utils.py
## process_doc_refs()
###### This bit could be simplified with parameters: copy paste the content of case 'smthng' and replace 'smthng' with _key_, if _key_ doesn't have a 'name' field it goes to next key, if the original content is not a DocumentReference it goes to next key ######
## create_doc()
###### Not sure that run_in_executor and creation of a new loop is needed since ChatGPT claims that the main advantage of run_in_executor is to use a sync function as an async one, wouldn't then just a simple await do the trick? ######
## async_get()
###### This exists so that the asyncio.gather() can have an awaitable from the * with the for loop, else you can't await doc.get so you can't .gather()

# Misc
###### Selectbox COMPONENT/function to select existing users/briefs/talents ######
###### Type hinting for each parameter and each return value (function reference) is a good practice, maybe can help with input validation for the site ######
###### Caching get_docs and db and other initializations must happen at some point ######
###### Functions should not rely on global variables ######
###### Firebase + db initialised every time? ######
###### Replace multiple 'await' in a row, or if multiple 'await' docs have to be appended to a list, with asyncio.gather(func1, func2, for loops with the * (unpacking) operator so each iteration is put as a different argument for the function etc.) ######
